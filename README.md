# Media Control - Raycast Extension for Windows

A seamless Windows media control extension for Raycast that automatically detects and controls your primary media source.

## Features

### ðŸŽµ **Smart Media Detection**
- Automatically detects the currently active media session on Windows
- Works with any media player that supports Windows Media Transport Controls
- Explicit YouTube title detection for Chrome, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Zen Browser
- Real-time updates of playback status and track information

#### Hybrid Detection
- Uses SMTC (Global System Media Transport Controls) sessions first for rich metadata and reliability.
- Falls back to window-title parsing for browsers to accurately detect YouTube titles (and Zenâ€™s various dashes).

#### Smart Selection (Option C)
- Prioritizes likely video sources (YouTube in browsers) over music when appropriate.
- Favors live streams (small bonus) and penalizes paused sessions.
- If browsers are paused and Spotify is playing, Spotify will be selected.
- Applies a small bonus when the media app is in the foreground window.

### ðŸŽ® **Comprehensive Controls**
- **Play/Pause Toggle** - `Cmd+Space`
- **Next Track** - `Cmd+Right Arrow`
- **Previous Track** - `Cmd+Left Arrow`
- **Volume Control** - `Cmd+Up/Down Arrow`
- **Quick Mute** - `Cmd+M`

### ðŸŽ¨ **Rich Interface**
- Live track information (title, artist, album)
- Visual playback status indicators
- App identification (Spotify, Chrome, VLC, etc.)
- Real-time volume display
- Last updated timestamps

### âš¡ **Powerful Actions**
- Instant media control without switching apps
- Volume adjustment in 10% increments
- Quick volume presets (50%, 100%)
- Auto-refresh every 2 seconds
- Manual refresh with `Cmd+R`

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** - Install via `winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS`
- **Raycast for Windows** - Download from [raycast.com](https://raycast.com/)

### Setup
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd media-control-raycast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. **Start development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **The extension will be automatically added to your Raycast installation**

## Usage

1. **Open Raycast** (`Alt+Space` by default)
2. **Type "media"** to find the Media Control extension
3. **View current track** information and playback status
4. **Use keyboard shortcuts** for quick control:
   - `Cmd+Space` - Play/Pause
   - `Cmd+Left/Right` - Previous/Next track
   - `Cmd+Up/Down` - Volume up/down
   - `Cmd+M` - Mute
   - `Cmd+R` - Refresh

## Supported Media Players

This extension works with any Windows application that implements the Windows Media Transport Controls API, including:

- **Spotify**
- **Chrome/Edge/Firefox** (YouTube, web players)
- **VLC Media Player**
- **Windows Media Player**
- **iTunes**
- **foobar2000**
- **And many more...**

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Platform:** Windows 10/11
- **Technology:** TypeScript, React, Raycast API
- **Media API:** Windows Media Transport Controls (GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager)
- **Volume Control:** Windows Audio Device APIs via PowerShell

### How It Works
1. **Media Detection:** Uses PowerShell to query processes and window titles, with app-specific patterns (Spotify, YouTube in Chrome/Brave/Edge/Firefox, VLC, etc.)
2. **Command Invocation:** The media detection script is written to a temporary .ps1 and executed via `-File` to avoid Windows command-line length limits
3. **Real-time Updates:** Polls media session every 2 seconds for live updates
4. **Control Commands:** Sends media control commands through Windows APIs
5. **Volume Management:** Integrates with Windows audio system for volume control

#### Temp Script Strategy
- All PowerShell code is written to uniquely named temp `.ps1` files via `createTempPsFile()` to avoid collisions.
- Files are opened with an exclusive write flag and removed in a `finally` block after execution to prevent lingering locked files and EBUSY errors.
- Applied to detection (`getCurrentMediaSession()`), media controls, and volume functions.

## Changelog

### v1.0.0 - 2025-08-09
- **Major Refactor:** Complete rewrite of media detection and control system
- **Smart Media Detection:** Hybrid SMTC + window-title approach with intelligent scoring (video-first, live bonus, paused penalty, foreground bonus)
- **Enhanced Browser Support:** Explicit YouTube detection for Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox, and Zen Browser (supports various dash formats)
- **Improved Reliability:** All PowerShell scripts now use temp files with `-File` execution to avoid command-line length limits and EBUSY errors
- **Better UX:** Close Raycast window before media controls, preserve last session when detection fails, correct video classification for YouTube
- **Robust Controls:** SMTC-based media controls with SendKeys fallback and synthetic media key injection via user32.dll
- **Volume Management:** Refactored volume functions to use temp file execution with `-STA` threading for improved stability

### Performance
- **Lightweight:** Minimal resource usage with efficient polling
- **Fast Response:** Instant media control with sub-second response times
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks when no media is playing
